    <p>You have questions about Firebase, and the Firebase community has answers!</p><br>
    
   <p> But do you know the best place to get your questions answered?</p><br><br>
    <p>
    It can be kind of overwhelming to figure out which destination is the best for your particular question. What I'd like to explore today are your options, and how to choose the best one. Choosing the best (and knowing how best to ask) could give you a huge advantage in getting the answers you need. There are five leading options, each with a different purpose. Let's explore those options!

    Firebase Cloud Messaging v1 Now Available from the Admin SDK
    </p><br>

    I'm always amazed when I think about the fact that Firebase Cloud Messaging sends billions of messages a day. Developers on iOS, Android, and web rely on FCM to send notifications and data messages to their clients. We recently updated FCM to incorporate better security and new features, and now you can access the new FCM through the Firebase Admin SDK for Node.js, Python, Java, and Go.

    Securing your Firebase Realtime Database just got easier with our newest feature: query-based rules. Query-based rules allow you to limit access to a subset of data. Need to restrict a query to return a maximum of 10 records? Want to ensure users are only retrieving the first 20 records instead of the last 20? Want to let a user query for only their documents? Not a problem. Query-based rules has you covered. Query-based rules can even help you simplify your data structure. Read on to learn how!
